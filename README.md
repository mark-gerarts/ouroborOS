# OuroborOS

A custom ublue spin that mostly just wraps some stuff that I like to have
preinstalled. Based on/kept in sync for a bit with [my Nixos
config](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/m).

Building:

```sh
ublue build recipes/recipe.yml
```

More info: [bluebuild docs](https://blue-build.org/learn/getting-started/).

## TODO

- Document installation/usage
- Wrap up todos from recipe
- Use custom logo
